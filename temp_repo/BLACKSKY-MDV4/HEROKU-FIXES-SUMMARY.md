# BLACKSKY-MD Premium Heroku 24/7 Operation Fixes

This document summarizes the key enhancements made to ensure the BLACKSKY-MD Premium WhatsApp Bot runs 24/7 on Heroku without downtime.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced PostgreSQL Database Integration

- **Fixed Database Connection Logic**: Modified `heroku-bot-starter.js` to properly detect and use PostgreSQL database
- **Immediate Database Flag**: Set `DATABASE_ENABLED` flag at the start of initialization to avoid race conditions
- **Session Table Creation**: Added proper error handling for session table creation
- **Automatic Database Recovery**: Enhanced recovery mechanisms if database connections fail

### 2. Internal Anti-Idle Mechanism

- **HEROKU_APP_URL Independence**: Bot now stays active even without setting HEROKU_APP_URL
- **Minimal Internal Activity**: Implements lightweight periodic activities to keep the process from sleeping
- **Profile Status Update**: Uses `updateProfileStatus` or `sendPresenceUpdate` to maintain connection activity
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Performs larger activities at specific intervals to minimize resource usage

### 3. Connection Stability Improvements

- **Enhanced Connection Keeper**: Improved mechanisms to detect and fix "connection appears to be closed" errors
- **Exponential Backoff**: Intelligent reconnection with increasing delays between attempts
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implements multiple fallback strategies for keeping connections alive
- **Redundant Session Storage**: Backs up sessions to both database and files for maximum reliability

### 4. Graceful Shutdown Handling

- **Pre-Shutdown Backup**: Ensures sessions are properly backed up before dyno cycling
- **Database Cleanup**: Properly closes database connections during shutdown
- **Signal Handling**: Catches SIGTERM and SIGINT signals for proper Heroku shutdown procedures
- **State Preservation**: Preserves connection state across restarts

### 5. Worker Process Configuration

- **Updated Procfile**: Created Procfile with `worker: node heroku-bot-starter.js` for proper Heroku worker dyno
- **App.json Worker Formation**: Changed app.json to use worker formation instead of web formation
- **Documentation**: Updated deployment guides to explain worker dyno usage

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy the improved version:

1. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database addon on Heroku
2. Deploy using the `worker` dyno, not the `web` dyno
3. Scale with: `heroku ps:scale worker=1 web=0`
4. No need to set HEROKU_APP_URL (though it can still be used if desired)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues:

1. Check logs with `heroku logs --tail`
2. Make sure PostgreSQL is properly provisioned
3. Restart the worker dyno with `heroku dyno:restart worker`
4. Verify worker dyno is running with `heroku ps`

These enhancements significantly improve the reliability of BLACKSKY-MD Premium on Heroku, allowing for true 24/7 operation without manual intervention.
