# BLACKSKY-MD Premium - Heroku 24/7 Operation Fixes

This document summarizes the key fixes and optimizations implemented to ensure 24/7 operation of BLACKSKY-MD on Heroku.

## 1. Connection Stability Improvements

- **Combined Runner Process**: Created `heroku-combined-runner.js` that runs both the main bot and connection keeper in a single Heroku dyno
- **Connection Keeper**: Enhanced `heroku-connection-keeper.js` to maintain stable WhatsApp connections
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Implemented exponential backoff reconnection strategy in case of disconnections
- **Heartbeat System**: Added periodic heartbeat messages to prevent WhatsApp server timeouts
- **Anti-Idle System**: Implemented a health check endpoint that prevents Heroku from putting the dyno to sleep

## 2. Session Persistence Across Dyno Cycles

- **PostgreSQL Session Backups**: Configured automatic session backup to PostgreSQL database
- **Backup Frequency**: Set up cron job to backup session every 30 minutes
- **Auto-Restore System**: Enhanced startup process to automatically restore session from PostgreSQL
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Added local file backups as secondary session persistence method
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Implemented proper shutdown handling to save session state before dyno restarts

## 3. Heroku-Specific Optimizations

- **Port Configuration**: Fixed port conflicts by using designated ports for different services
- **Health Check System**: Added dedicated health check endpoint that reports bot status
- **Procfile Configuration**: Updated to use the combined runner for optimal operation
- **Build Process**: Added required buildpacks for media processing capabilities
- **Environment Variables**: Documented all required environment variables in app.json
- **Resource Allocation**: Recommended eco dyno for cost-effective 24/7 operation
- **Memory Management**: Added automatic memory optimization for Heroku's limited resources

## 4. Recommended Environment Variables

```
SESSION_ID=BLACKSKY-MD
BOT_NAME=BLACKSKY-MD
OWNER_NUMBER=your-number-here
NODE_ENV=production
HEROKU=true
HEROKU_APP_URL=https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com
ENABLE_HEALTH_CHECK=true
ENABLE_SESSION_BACKUP=true
BACKUP_INTERVAL=30
ENABLE_MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION=true
```

## 5. Database Configuration

- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Set up Heroku PostgreSQL for session persistence
- **Auto-creation of Tables**: Added automatic table creation for storing session data
- **Connection Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling for database connection issues
- **Database Pool Management**: Configured proper connection pooling for PostgreSQL operations

## 6. Deployment Improvements

- **Direct Deployment Button**: Added one-click "Deploy to Heroku" button
- **Dockerfile Configuration**: Updated Dockerfile for Heroku container support
- **heroku.yml Support**: Added heroku.yml for container-based deployment
- **Updated Documentation**: Created comprehensive deployment guides

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Upgrade to Paid Plan**: For truly 24/7 operation, we recommend at least the "Eco" ($5/month) dyno type
2. **Set Up Monitoring**: Consider integrating with a monitoring service for uptime alerts
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep the bot up to date with the latest security patches
4. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of WhatsApp's rate limits to avoid temporary blocks

---

*These fixes work together to provide a robust solution for running BLACKSKY-MD Premium on Heroku with minimal downtime, proper handling of Heroku's dyno cycling, and resilient session management.*
